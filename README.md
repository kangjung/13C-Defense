13C-Defense for the js13kGames competition 2023. (Theme for this year is 13th Century.)

While thinking about the theme of the 13th century, I thought about making a game related to the Mongol army. I was inspired by battles involving Mongol troops in the 13th century, including the [Battle_of_Cheoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cheoin).

Like a typical defense game, enemies (Mongolians) move along a set path.
Eliminate enemies before they approach the gate.
